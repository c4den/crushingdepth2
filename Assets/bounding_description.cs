// This script exists to explain the purposes of the bounding box found on the outside section of the first level.
// the game asset 'play_area_bounding_box' is made to serve as a rigidbody that prevents players from moving past it's bounds, keeping them... in bounds.
// I think it's fairly simple, but if you find it not so, then please feel free to ask me (Caden) what the purpose is.
